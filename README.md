# Diet-Obesity-and-Covid-19
Simple data visualization comparing few countries related to the diet, obesity rate and covid-19 related information<br>
Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset <br>
Thank you very much for Ms Maria Ren for providing these datasets!<br>

This notebook was produced when I played around using the datasets related to the diet information across countries. I didn't compare a lot of countries, in fact I only compare less than 10 countries -- with short and simple visualization. It's not really thorough, but it gives me idea about different diets across countries. Although I personally think there are a lot of factors influencing diseases (including obesity, undernourished, and covid-19), dietary behaviour should also be taken into account.
